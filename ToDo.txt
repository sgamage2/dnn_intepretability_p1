1. Significance distribution plot (like SHAP plots)
2. Average sig. plot --> take mean(abs(score)), so that signed feature sig values will not average to ~zero
3. LSTM adding problem --> mark the 2 significance points (ground truth) with arrows
4. Fix a random seed to get rid of randomness
    4.1. Check that ANN toy problem dataset is properly generated (that 1st 4 features are infact significant)
5. Implement 2 sig. methods: gradients, occlusion
6. Implement 2 metrics: sanity checks, pixel flipping
7. MNIST ANN toy problem (just to verify)
