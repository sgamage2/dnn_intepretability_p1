# Similar structure to other exp scripts
# eg: run_exp_lstm_toy_problem.py

# But load only part of the dataset (because it's too big)

# Challenge: model has both CNN and LSTM parts. We will likely not be able to simply call the feature sig methods (will need custom versions of current functions)

# ToDo for Sunanda: help with plotting feature sig heatmaps on input video frames (check plot functions in run_exp_ann_mnist.py
